# Idea Board API

An Idea board app built as a Rails 5.1 API app, based on the [Rails 5 API and React.js tutorial - How to make an Idea board app](https://learnetto.com/tutorials/rails-5-api-and-react-js-tutorial-how-to-make-an-idea-board-app).

The app has API endpoints for adding, editing and deleting ideas.

See this [React frontend app code](https://github.com/learnetto/ideaboard) to talk to this API.
