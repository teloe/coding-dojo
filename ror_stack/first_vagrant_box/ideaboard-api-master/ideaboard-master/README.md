# Idea Board

An Idea board frontend app built using Create React App, based on the [Rails 5 API and React.js tutorial - How to make an Idea board app](https://learnetto.com/tutorials/rails-5-api-and-react-js-tutorial-how-to-make-an-idea-board-app).

The app talks to an API which has endpoints for adding, editing and deleting ideas.

See this [Rails 5.1 API app code](https://github.com/learnetto/ideaboard-api) for the backend API.
